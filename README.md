# BulkUpload
Project Description: Bulk Data Upload and Update in Django Database

This project aims to develop a data management system in Django that allows users to upload bulk data from an Excel spreadsheet to a database. The system will handle the creation of new records and updating of existing records based on a unique identifier.

Here's how the project will work:

Data Generation: Fake data will be generated using a tool like Mokaro website, creating a dataset with multiple fields representing the attributes of each record.

Excel Parsing: The system will include a module that can parse Excel files. It will utilize libraries such as pandas or openpyxl to read the data from the spreadsheet and extract the necessary information.

Database Integration: A Django project will be set up, with a configured database. A Django model will be created to match the structure of the data in the Excel spreadsheet. This model will serve as the blueprint for the records in the database.

Data Comparison: For each row of data extracted from the Excel file, the system will query the database to check if a record with a matching unique identifier (e.g., primary key or a specific field) already exists. This can be achieved using Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to perform efficient searches.

Record Creation or Update: If the system finds that a record with the same unique identifier already exists, it will update the corresponding values with the data from the Excel row. Otherwise, if the record does not exist, a new record will be created in the database using the data from the Excel row.

Logging and Error Handling: A logging mechanism will be implemented to capture any errors or exceptions that occur during the upload process. This will aid in troubleshooting and identifying any issues related to the data or database operations.

User Interface (Optional): The system may include a user interface where users can upload the Excel file and initiate the data upload process. This interface can be developed using Django's built-in forms or a front-end framework like Django templates or React.
